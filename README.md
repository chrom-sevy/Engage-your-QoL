# About

This mod pack engages with your QoL and aims to save you time and remove some annoying parts of rng without changing the gameplay if possible.

# Install on Ryujinx

1. Right Click on Fire Emblem Engage
2. choose 'open Mod Location'
3. copy the repo into the folder by
    a. `git clone https://github.com/chrom-sevy/Engage-your-QoL.git` if you have git installed (also let's get uptodate via `git pull` very easily)
    b. click on this page's `code<>` and get the zip file
4. reboot your game

## Additional Info

- I have included a `global bond sp` patch--so if you care about early Bond Fragment economy, I recommend deleting this patch until you have enough rings to fill your slots. (note that you need to delete this again after a `git pull`)
